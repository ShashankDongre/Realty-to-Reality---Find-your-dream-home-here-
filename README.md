Project Title:
Realty to Reality – The search for your dream home ends now!

About the project:
The primary objective of this project is to create a MySQL Database which would help people figure out what it would cost them to buy a property or home in the counties in and around Boston in the next 12 months. The project comprises data scraped from various real estate and property marketplaces like Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia, Apartments.com, FSBO.com, etc. This database differentiates itself from the competition by taking into consideration numerous factors such as target audience, median annual income of the audience, the median cost of a standard 1000 sqft house in the counties, proximities to essential infrastructure like public schools, hospitals, and health centers, ease of transportation, proximities to the technology hub, the safety of the neighborhood, noise, and community, interest rate for mortgages, rental yields, the estimated payment and costs towards the end user, etc. All related data would be procured from trusted online webpages and research companies.
The database would act as a foundation for the aggregation of major online real estate marketplaces. With all the complexities taken care of, this database could be the foundation of becoming an online real estate database aggregator mobile application of web portal shortly.
